# Neural Call Application Restructuring Phases

## Phase 1: Fix Sidebar Hierarchy & Remove Obsolete Navigation ✅

**Goal:** Correct the visual layout of the sidebar and remove conflicting header/sidebar elements.

- [x] Located and modified the Sidebar component (`src/components/layout/Sidebar.tsx`)
- [x] Reordered sidebar sections to place "Campaign Call Logs" as the first main group after "Dashboard"
- [x] Removed the old sidebar "Campaigns" section with static links
- [x] Removed the "Campaigns" tab from the header navigation in `src/components/layout/Header.tsx`

## Phase 2: Implement Global State & Contextual Dashboard ✅

**Goal:** Establish the state management for tracking the selected campaign and make the Dashboard reflect this context.

- Created `CampaignContext.tsx` in `src/contexts/CampaignContext.tsx` with:
  - State variables: `selectedCampaign`, `setSelectedCampaign`
  - Provider component that wraps the application
  - Custom hook `useCampaign` for components to access the context
- Wrapped the entire application with `CampaignProvider` in `App.tsx`
- Updated the Sidebar component to use the context:
  - Set selected campaign on campaign link click
  - Clear selection on Dashboard link click
- Implemented contextual Dashboard in `src/pages/dashboard/DashboardPage.tsx`:
  - Consuming campaign context to get selected campaign
  - Conditional rendering based on selection status
  - Filtering data for selected campaign or showing aggregate data
  - Dynamic page title showing campaign name or "All Campaigns"

## Phase 3: Connect Analytics, Performance, Reports to Global Context ✅

**Goal:** Ensure all data-displaying sections strictly adhere to the selected campaign context.

- Created `useCallAnalytics` hook to centralize data filtering logic
- Modified core components across all major sections:
  - Analytics components (`Overview`, `CallAnalytics`, `PerformanceMetrics`, etc.)
  - Performance components (`AgentPerformance`, `CampaignPerformance`, etc.)
  - Reports page
- Implemented consistent filtering pattern in each component:
  - Getting selected campaign from context
  - Filtering data source based on campaign ID
  - Calculating metrics only from filtered data
  - Adding UI elements to indicate context (campaign name in titles)
  - Showing prompt messages when no campaign is selected
- Added campaign-specific and aggregate views for all data visualizations

## Phase 4: Implement Functional "+ New Campaign" Button ✅

**Goal:** Allow users to dynamically add campaigns to the sidebar list and generate necessary info.

- Added "+ New Campaign" button next to "Campaign Call Logs" in the sidebar
- Created `NewCampaignModal` component with form for campaign creation
- Implemented form with fields for campaign name
- Added logic to:
  - Generate unique campaign IDs
  - Create webhook URLs
  - Add new campaigns to mock data
  - Close modal after creation
- Ensured webhook URL is displayed when editing existing campaigns
- Verified that newly created campaigns appear immediately in the sidebar

## Phase 5: Final Comprehensive Testing ✅

**Goal:** Rigorously test the entire restructured workflow and data context switching.

- Verified sidebar structure and navigation:
  - "Campaign Call Logs" at the top of sidebar
  - Removed old "Campaigns" section and header tab
- Tested campaign selection and call log navigation:
  - Click "Debt Calls" → shows Debt Calls log
  - Click "Roofing" → shows Roofing log
- Verified contextual data display:
  - Selected "Debt Calls" → Dashboard, Analytics, Performance, Reports show only Debt Calls data
  - Selected "Roofing" → verified all sections updated to show only Roofing data
  - Clicked main "Dashboard" → verified sections reset to show aggregate data
- Tested new campaign creation:
  - Used "+ New Campaign" to add "Solar"
  - Verified "Solar" appears in sidebar
  - Selected "Solar" to see empty call log
  - Checked Analytics to verify it shows "Solar" context
  - Edited "Solar" to verify webhook URL is displayed
- Checked all sections to ensure no regressions or errors

## Summary of Changes

The application has been successfully restructured to implement the correct user flow:

1. Users can select campaigns from the sidebar "Campaign Call Logs" section
2. Upon selection, users see call details for that specific campaign
3. All data views (Dashboard, Analytics, Performance, Reports) now display data filtered by the selected campaign
4. Users can add new campaigns that appear immediately in the sidebar
5. The application maintains consistent context and provides clear UI indicators of the current selection

This implementation ensures that the application properly maintains context across all views and provides a coherent user experience focused on campaign-specific data analysis.
